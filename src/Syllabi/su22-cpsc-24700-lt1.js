			Documentation should be submitted to academicservices@lewisu.edu .</li>
			<li>Students experiencing disruptions in their lives related to the Coronavirus that impact class 
			attendance and participation should:</li>
			<ul>

		department/program level. Appeal of the department /program decision must be made to the Dean of 
		the college/school. The Dean reviews the appeal and makes the final decision in all cases except those in 
		which suspension or expulsion is recommended, and in these cases the Provost makes the final decision.</p>
