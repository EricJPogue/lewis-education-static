	description: 
		`This course explores the field of computer science. It provides an overview of computer architecture, 
		networking, data organization and computational theory. Students will be introduced to fundamental concepts 
		underlying all of computing, such as algorithms, abstractions, and how computers represent numbers, text, 
		images, and sound. Students will learn the basics of programming and computational problem solving.`,
