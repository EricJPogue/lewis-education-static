    provide metrics This is the section where you provide how you will measure your what will be done during the sprint. Forced rank 4
    track defects This will let you follow defects as they are found and managed through support. Forced Rank: 6
    utilize source code control This will allow you to manage the source code for your project. Forced Rank: 3
    refactor code This allows you to be able to make code more readable and understandable for other editors. Forced Rank: 7
    program in pairs This allows two or more people to work on the same task. Forced Rank: 5
    utilize Saas This will allow you to use Software as a Service. This allows us to be able to even use Azure, AWS, and other such resources Forced Rank: 1
    test This is where you see if your product meets the specified result by the end of the sprint Forced Rank: 2

My reasoning for this ordering is as follows. First, utilizing SAAS will allow us to be able to develop software, which is the purpose of this project, at a much faster rate then before. Second, testing allows us to check and see if our project meets what has been required of us for the sprint. Third, utilizing source code control will allow the code to have a baseline done feature, with different teams/members working on different branches to test out potential add-ons for future projects. Fourth, providing metric will allow the team to have a goal to work towards during the sprint. Fifth, being able to program in pairs will give a second set of eyes to catch bugs that could have been missed, as well as a more knowledgeable second opinion. Sixth, tracking defects will allow the development team to manage issues in their project, as well as see where the weak parts of the project is. Seventh, refactoring code would make it easier for a new team to see what needs to be worked on, but this should be engrained in the developers from the beginning.
